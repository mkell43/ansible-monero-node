At this time, August 2018, you will need a disk with around 60G free to run a full monero node.  I have one running on a VPS at [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) and another on [Vultr](https://vultr.com).

If you would like to help me in keeping those running please feel free to donate a lil' or sign up with one of those hosting providers using a referral link below.
